# hotel_chain
The clients of the hotel chain have an opportunity to cancel their reservations, which leads to the fact that some rooms are empty even in high season. The company management would like to introduce the practice of overbooking - the possibility of booking more rooms than the hotel has available.
But an ill-conceived system of overbooking can lead to the fact that guests will really have nowhere to stay. Therefore, my task is to make a high-quality and accurate forecast of overbooking failures.
